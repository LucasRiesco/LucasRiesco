👋 Hi, I’m @LucasRiesco, an architect with expertise in bioclimatic design. My focus is on integrating computational tools, particularly Grasshopper, Python, and data analysis, into architectural practices to enhance parametric design and bioclimatic principles.

👀 I’m interested in leveraging my skills in computational design and data analysis to create sustainable and innovative architectural solutions. Exploring the intersection of architecture, parametricism, and bioclimatism is my passion.

🌱 I’m currently learning and expanding my knowledge in Python, with a focus on data analysis and artificial intelligence. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve computational design, parametric modeling, and applications of artificial intelligence in architecture. I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts in the field.
